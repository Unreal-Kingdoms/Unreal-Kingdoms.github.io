# Welcome to the Unreal Kingdoms GitHub Pages!

Here we maintain several internal projects as well as a few open source toolkits for the community. Player and creator documentation is also housed and developed here!

Unreal Kingdoms is owned by Cyber Ape Yacht Club with the purpose of being the biggest and most intuitive metaverse on the world! Meet our Metaverse full of creatures. Defeat them to earn collectible NFTs which you can sell, trade, or take them to your next adventure. Unreal Kingdoms has created the first Multiverse metaverse that will bring brands, projects and communities together.

Play, Engage, Learn, Work, Earn and Grow
